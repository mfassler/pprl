Player Piano Reinforcement Learning

This is an experiment with a new style of reinfocement learning.

All of my reinfocement learning concepts are based on the paper:

    "A neural network model with dopamine-like reinforcement signal 
     that learns a spatial delayed response task."
         by Suri and Schultz 1999

     DOI: 10.1016/S0306-4522(98)00697-6


My goal is to reproduce their mathematical results, but using a 2-dimensional
model based on the metaphor of a player piano (a scrolling 2-D array, with one
dimension being time.)
